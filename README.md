# Airspeed Velocity benchmarks for *SMPyBandits*

This repository contains code (and soon, also results) of benchmarks for the [SMPyBandits](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/) python package, using the [airspeed velocity](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html) tool.

This project is written by [Lilian Besson's](https://perso.crans.org/besson/), written in [Python (2 or 3)](https://www.python.org/), to test the quality of [SMPyBandits](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/), my open-source Python package for numerical simulations on :slot_machine: *single*-player and *multi*-players [Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) algorithms.

A complete Sphinx-generated documentation for [SMPyBandits](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/) is on [SMPyBandits.GitHub.io](https://smpybandits.github.io/).

> [I (Lilian Besson)](https://perso.crans.org/besson/) have [started my PhD](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/) in October 2016, and this is a part of my **on going** research since December 2016.
>
> I launched the [documentation](https://smpybandits.github.io/) on March 2017, I wrote my first research articles using this framework in 2017 and decided to (finally) open-source my project in February 2018.

## How to cite this work?
If you use this package for your own work, please consider citing it with [this piece of BibTeX](SMPyBandits.bib):


```bibtex
@misc{SMPyBandits,
    title =   {{SMPyBandits: an Open-Source Research Framework for Single and Multi-Players Multi-Arms Bandits (MAB) Algorithms in Python}},
    author =  {Lilian Besson},
    year =    {2018},
    url =     {https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/},
    howpublished = {Online at: \url{github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits}},
    note =    {Code at https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/, documentation at https://smpybandits.github.io/}
}
```

I also wrote a small paper to present *SMPyBandits*, and I will send it to [JMLR MLOSS](http://jmlr.org/mloss/).
The paper can be consulted [here on my website](https://perso.crans.org/besson/articles/SMPyBandits.pdf).

> A DOI will arrive as soon as possible! I tried to publish [a paper](docs/paper/paper.md) on both [JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/) and [MLOSS](http://mloss.org/software/).
